## Project Overview

Welcome to the Movie Website! This is a modern, responsive web application built with React and Vite, designed to explore movies and TV shows using the TMDb API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayliki/Movies_Website.git
cd Movies_Website
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure TMDb API Key

You will need a TMDb API key to fetch movie and TV show data.
1.  Go to [The Movie Database (TMDb) website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and create an account if you don't have one.
2.  Once logged in, navigate to your [API settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
3.  Request a new API key (Developer / Request an API Key).
4.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (where `package.json` is located).
5.  Add your API key to the `.env` file like this:

    ```
    VITE_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual TMDb API key).

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 5. Build for production (optional)

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production-ready build.
